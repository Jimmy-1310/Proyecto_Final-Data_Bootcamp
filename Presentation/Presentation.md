## Theme

- **Selected Topic:** Determining obesity levels based on eating habits and physical condition.

- **Reasons for topic selection:** In 2016, Mexico declared an epidomiological alert regading its stats in obesity (Barquera, White. 2018). 72% of its adult population is either obese or overweight. This stats leave to healt-related problems, such as diabetes or hearth conditions related with high levels of cholesterol. Taking this into account, we have decided to dig a bit further and understand the why of this problem. Because we are a team based in Mexico it is a situation that we see develop day by day in our everyday life. The concers for the public health of the mexican population guides us into help it find a root cause, to then suggest possible changes to later solve the problem.
