### Communication

In order to fully coordinate the team, we have decided to create a Whatsapp groupchat for quick messaging. The benefits of using these messaging app is the quickness to contact each other, because we all have our cellphones close to us most of the time. This group chat will be used to mantain a more informal way of communication and urgent messages, such as merging branches or any extra changes any team member commits.
For more technical aspects, we will use a slack chanel. In this chanel we expect to share links or resources that will be used in our project in order to make it easier to acces in our computers.
