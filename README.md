## Team

### Members
- Kathia Flores
- Rosa Tejeda
- Jaime Castillo 

### Roles

- **Square Role:** This role is in charge of creating and setting up the github repositories. It is also responsible for mantaining its integrity. The member that will be playing this role is *Jaime Castillo*
- **Triangle Role:** This role is in charge of developing a Machine Learning Algorithm that will be able to estimate results based on eating habits. The member that will be playing this roles is *Kathia Flores*
- **Circle Role:** This role is in charge of creating a database that will be able to store and organize all the tables of the data set. The memebar that will be playing this role is *Rosa Tejeda*

### Communication

In order to fully coordinate the team, we have decided to create a Whatsapp groupchat for quick messaging. The benefits of using these messaging app is the quickness to contact each other, because we all have our cellphones close to us most of the time. This group chat will be used to mantain a more informal way of communication and urgent messages, such as merging branches or any extra changes any team member commits.
For more technical aspects, we will use a slack chanel. In this chanel we expect to share links or resources that will be used in our project in order to make it easier to acces in our computers.

## Communication Protocols

### Technologies

- Data Storage: For the data storage were are going to use a Postgres Database hosted in Amazon Web Services. 
- ML model:
- Data Visualization: In order to create and organize helpful visualizations to give critical insight into what the data tells us, we are going to be using Tableau public. 
- Final Presentation: In order to colaborate and develop a descriptive presentation we are going to use Google Slides.

## Project Overview

![Obesity](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95836718/169713265-3e8c5c34-352d-46da-8a41-723e5591649c.jpg)

### Outline

For this project we are trying to put into work what we learned during this bootcamp to try and solve a problematic. We are focusing on the obesity problematic among the mexican population. We are going to train a supervised Machine Learning Model in order to predict and judge the eating habits of the population, so that they can evaluate their habits and see if they need to make a change.

### Theme

- **Selected Topic:** Determining obesity levels based on eating habits and physical condition.

- **Reasons for topic selection:** 
According to WHO, obesity and overweight have reached epidemic proportions. Obesity rates have almost tripled since 1975 and have increased almost fivefold in children and adolescents, affecting people of all ages from all social groups in the Region of the Americas and the world.

The Region of the Americas has the highest prevalence of all over the World Health Organization regions, with 62.5% of adults overweight or obese (64.1% of men and 60.9% of women). If only obesity is examined, it is estimated that it affects 28% of the adult population (26% of men and 31% of women).
Overweight and obesity are defined as an abnormal or excessive accumulation of fat that can be detrimental to health.

Body mass index (BMI) is a simple indicator of the relationship between weight and height that is frequently used to identify overweight and obesity in adults.

Added to this, i n 2016, Mexico declared an epidomiological alert regading its stats in obesity (Barquera, White. 2018). 72% of its adult population is either obese or overweight. This stats leave to healt-related problems, such as diabetes or hearth conditions related with high levels of cholesterol. 

Taking this into account, we have decided to dig a bit further and understand the why of this problem. Because we are a team based in Mexico it is a situation that we see develop day by day in our everyday life. The concers for the public health of the mexican population guides us into help it find a root cause, to then suggest possible changes to later solve the problem.

- Data sources description: The Datasource was retrieved in the UCI page. The data is originated from a paper created by Fabio Mendoza and Alexis de la Hoz in 2019, it describes the eating habits and physical conditions of people between the ages of 14 and 61 years old. The nationalities of the people in the study are Mexican, Colombian and Peruvian. The dataset contains 2111 rows and 17 attributes. Each row represents a single person. 
The atributes of the dataset are:
  - Gender
  - Age
  - Height
  - Weight
  - Family History
  - FAVC (Frequent Consumption of High Caloric Food)
  - FCVC (Frequent Consumption of Vegetables)
  - NCP (Number of Main Meals)
  - CAEC (Consumption of Food Between Meals)
  - Smoke (Does the Person Smokes?)
  - CH20 (Consumption of Water)
  - CALC (Consumption of Alcohol)
  - SCC (Calories Consumption Monitoring)
  - FAF (Physical Activity Frequency)
  - TUE (Time Using Technology Devices)
  - MTRANS (Transportation Used)
  - NObesity (Class Variable of Each Persons Condition)

The attributes related to eating habits are the following:
•	FAVC
•	FCVC
•	NCP
•	CAEC
•	CH20
•	CALC

The attributes related to physical condition are:
•	SCC
•	FAF
• TUE
•	MTRANS

Other variables obtained:
•	Gender
•	Age
•	Height 
•	Weight

- Questions: 
- Can we predict the NObesity lavel of each person based on its eating and physical habits? 
- Do a person's daily habits affect the level of BMI they have
-	What habit could have greater relevance to suffer from obesity or overweight?

- Data exploration: For the data exploration phase we used tableau in order to look and identify possible trends or skews in the datasets. We created different visualizations and identify possible restrictions and upgrades that could be done in the future.

- Analysis phase: For this part we read and analyze to identify real life problematics that this data set could help us try and solve them in a small scale.
